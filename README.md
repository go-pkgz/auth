# auth - authentication via oauth2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/go-pkgz/auth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/go-pkgz/auth) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/go-pkgz/auth/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/go-pkgz/auth?branch=master) [![godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-pkgz/auth?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-pkgz/auth)



This library provides "social login" with Github, Google, Facebook and Yandex as well as custom auth providers.  

- Multiple oauth2 providers can be used at the same time
- Special `dev` provider allows local testing and development
- JWT stored in a secure cookie with XSRF protection. Cookies can be session-only
- Minimal scopes with user name, id and picture (avatar) only
- Direct authentication with user's provided credential checker
- Verified authentication with user's provided sender (email, im, etc)
- Integrated avatar proxy with FS, boltdb and gridfs storage
- Support of user-defined storage for avatars
- Identicon for default avatars  
- Black list with user-defined validator
- Multiple aud (audience) supported
- Secure key with customizable `SecretReader`
- Ability to store an extra information to token and retrieve on login
- Pre-auth and post-auth hooks to handle custom use cases. 
- Middleware for easy integration into http routers
- Wrappers to extract user info from the request

## Install

`go get -u github.com/go-pkgz/auth`

## Usage

Example with chi router:

```go

func main() {
	/// define options
	options := auth.Opts{
		SecretReader: token.SecretFunc(func(id string) (string, error) { // secret key for JWT
			return "secret", nil
		}),
		TokenDuration:  time.Minute * 5, // token expires in 5 minutes
		CookieDuration: time.Hour * 24,  // cookie expires in 1 day and will enforce re-login
		Issuer:         "my-test-app",
		URL:            "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
		AvatarStore:    avatar.NewLocalFS("/tmp"),
		Validator: token.ValidatorFunc(func(_ string, claims token.Claims) bool {
			// allow only dev_* names
			return claims.User != nil && strings.HasPrefix(claims.User.Name, "dev_")
		}),
	}

	// create auth service with providers
	service := auth.NewService(options)
	service.AddProvider("github", "<Client ID>", "<Client Secret>")   // add github provider
	service.AddProvider("facebook", "<Client ID>", "<Client Secret>") // add facebook provider

	// retrieve auth middleware
	m := service.Middleware()

	// setup http server
	router := chi.NewRouter()
	router.Get("/open", openRouteHandler)                      // open api
	router.With(m.Auth).Get("/private", protectedRouteHandler) // protected api

	// setup auth routes
	authRoutes, avaRoutes := service.Handlers()
	router.Mount("/auth", authRoutes)  // add auth handlers
	router.Mount("/avatar", avaRoutes) // add avatar handler

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
}
```

## Middleware

`github.com/go-pkgz/auth/middleware` provides ready-to-use middleware.

- `middleware.Auth` - requires authenticated user
- `middleware.Admin` - requires authenticated and admin user
- `middleware.Trace` - doesn't require authenticated user, but adds user info to request

## Details

Generally, adding support of `auth` includes a few relatively simple steps:

1. Setup `auth.Opts` structure with all parameters. Each of them [documented](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/auth.go#L29) and most of parameters are optional and have sane defaults.
2. [Create](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/auth.go#L56) the new `auth.Service` with provided options.
3. [Add all](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/auth.go#L149) desirable authentication providers. Currently supported Github, Google, Facebook and Yandex 
4. Retrieve [middleware](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/auth.go#L144) and [http handlers](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/auth.go#L105) from `auth.Service`
5. Wire auth and avatar handlers into http router as subâ€“routes.

### API

For the example above authentication handlers wired as `/auth` and provides:

- `/auth/<provider>/login?id=<site_id>&from=<redirect_url>` - site_id used as `aud` claim for the token and can be processed by `SecretReader` to load/retrieve/define different secrets. redirect_url is the url to redirect after successful login.
- `/avatar/<avatar_id>` - returns the avatar (image). Links to those pictures added into user info automatically, for details see "Avatar proxy"
- `/auth/<provider>/logout` and `/auth/logout` - invalidate "session" by removing JWT cookie
- `/auth/list` - gives a json list of active providers 
- `/auth/user` - returns `token.User` (json)

### User info

Middleware populates `token.User` to request's context. It can be loaded with `token.GetUserInfo(r *http.Request) (user User, err error)` or `token.MustGetUserInfo(r *http.Request) User` functions.

`token.User` object includes all fields retrieved from oauth2 provider:
- `Name` - user name
- `ID` - hash of user id
- `Picture` - full link to proxied avatar (see "Avatar proxy")

It also has placeholders for fields application can populate with custom `token.ClaimsUpdater` (see "Customization")

- `IP`  - hash of user's IP address
- `Email` - user's email
- `Attributes` - map of string:any-value. To simplify management of this map some setters and getters provided, for example `users.StrAttr`, `user.SetBoolAttr` and so on. See [user.go](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/token/user.go) for more details.
 
   
### Avatar proxy

Direct links to avatars won't survive any real-life usage if they linked from a public page. For example, page [like this](https://remark42.com/demo/) may have hundreds of avatars and, most likely, will trigger throttling on provider's side. To eliminate such restriction `auth` library provides an automatic proxy

- On each login the proxy will retrieve user's picture and save it to `AvatarStore`
- Local (proxied) link to avatar included in user's info (jwt token)
- API for avatar removal provided as a part of `AvatarStore`
- User can leverage one of the provided stores:
    - `avatar.LocalFS` - file system, each avatar in a separate file
    - `avatar.BoltDB`  - single [boltdb](https://github.com/coreos/bbolt) file (embedded KV store).
    - `avatar.GridFS` - external [GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/) (mongo db).
- In case of need custom implementations of other stores can be passed in and used by `auth` library. Each store has to implement `avatar.Store` [interface](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/avatar/store.go#L25).
- All avatar-related setup done as a part of `auth.Opts` and needs:
    - `AvatarStore` - avatar store to use, i.e. `avatar.NewLocalFS("/tmp/avatars")`
    - `AvatarRoutePath` - route prefix for direct links to proxied avatar. For example `/api/v1/avatars` will make full links like this - `http://example.com/api/v1/avatars/1234567890123.image`. The url will be stored in user's token and retrieved by middleware (see "User Info")
    - `AvatarResizeLimit` - size (in pixels) used to resize the avatar. Pls note - resize happens once as a part of `Put` call, i.e. on login. 0 size (default) disables resizing.      

### Direct authentication

In addition to oauth2 providers `auth.Service` allows to use direct user-defined authentication. This is done by adding direct provider with `auth.AddDirectProvider`. 

```go
	service.AddDirectProvider("local", provider.CredCheckerFunc(func(user, password string) (ok bool, err error) {
		ok, err := checkUserSomehow(user, password) 
		return ok, err
	}))
```

Such provider acts like any other, i.e. will be registered as `/auth/local/login`. 

The API for this provider - `GET /auth/<name>/login?user=<user>&passwd=<password>&aud=<site_id>&session=[1|0]`

_note: password parameter doesn't have to be naked/real password and can be any kind of password hash prepared by caller._ 

### Verified authentication

Another non-oauth2 provider allowing user-confirmed authentication, for example by email or slack or telegram. This is 
done by adding confirmed provider with `auth.AddVerifProvider`.
 
```go
    msgTemplate := "Confirmation email, token: {{.Token}}"
	service.AddVerifProvider("email", msgTemplate, sender)
```

Message template may use the follow elements:

- `{{.Address}}` - user address, for example email
- `{{.User}}` - user name
- `{{.Token}}` - confirmation token
- `{{.Site}}` - site ID

Sender should be provided by end-user and implements a single function interface

```go
type Sender interface {
	Send(address string, text string) error
}
```

For convenience a functional wrapper `SenderFunc` provided. Email sender provided in `provider/sender` package and can be 
used as `Sender`.

The API for this provider:

 - `GET /auth/<name>/login?user=<user>&address=<adsress>&aud=<site_id>&from=<url>` - send confirmation request to user
 - `GET /auth/<name>/login?token=<conf.token>&sess=[1|0]` - authorize with confirmation token

The provider acts like any other, i.e. will be registered as `/auth/email/login`.
  
### Customization

There are several ways to adjust functionality of the library:

1. `SecretReader` - interface with a single method `Get(aud string) string` to return the secret used for JWT signing and verification
2. `ClaimsUpdater` - interface with `Update(claims Claims) Claims` method. This is the primary way to alter a token at login time and add any attributes, set ip, email, admin status and so on.
3. `Validator` - interface with `Validate(token string, claims Claims) bool` method. This is post-token hook and will be called on **each request** wrapped with `Auth` middleware. This will be the place for special logic to reject some tokens or users.

All of the interfaces above have corresponding Func adapters - `SecretFunc`, `ClaimsUpdFunc` and `ValidatorFunc`.

### Implementing black list logic or some other filters

Restricting some users or some tokens is two step process:

- `ClaimsUpdater` sets an attribute, like `blocked` (or `allowed`)
- `Validator` checks the attribute and returns true/false 

_This technic used in the [example](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/_example/backend/main.go#L36) code_

The process can be simplified by doing all checks directly in `Validator`, but depends on particular case such solution
can be too expensive because `Validator` runs on each request as a part of auth middleware. In contrast, `ClaimsUpdater` called on token creation/refresh only.

### Multi-tenant services and support for different audiences 

For complex systems a single authenticator may serve multiple distinct subsystems or multiple set of independent users. For example some SaaS offerings may need to provide different authentications for different customers and prevent use of tokens/cookies made by another customer. 

Such functionality can be implemented in 3 different ways:

- Different instances of `auth.Service` each one with different secret. Doing this way will ensure the highest level of isolation and cookies/tokens won't be even parsable across the instances. Practically such architecture can be too complicated and not always possible.
â€“ Handling "allowed audience" as a part of `ClaimsUpdater` and `Validator` chain. I.e. `ClaimsUpdater` sets a claim indicating expected audience code/id and `Validator` making sure it matches. This way a single `auth.Service` could handle multiple groups of auth tokens and reject some based on the audience.
- Using the standard JWT `aud` claim. This method conceptually very similar to the previous one, but done by library internally and consumer don't need to define special  `ClaimsUpdater` and `Validator` logic.

In order to allow `aud` support the list of allowed audiences should be passed in as `opts.Audiences` parameter. Non-empty value will trigger internal checks for token generation (will reject token creation fot alien `aud`) as well as `Auth` middleware.


### Dev provider

Working with oauth2 providers can be a pain, especially during development phase. A special, development-only provider `dev` can make it less painful. This one can be registered directly, i.e. `service.AddProvider("dev", "", "")` and should be activated like this:

```go
	// runs dev oauth2 server on :8084
	go func() {
		devAuthServer, err := service.DevAuth()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		devAuthServer.Run()
	}()
```

It will run fake aouth2 "server" on port :8084 and user could login with any user name. See [example](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/_example/backend/main.go) for more details. 

_Warning: this is not the real oauth2 server but just a small fake thing for development and testing only. Don't use `dev` provider with any production code._

### Other ways to authenticate

In addition to the primary method (i.e. JWT cookie with XSRF header) there are two more ways to authenticate:

1. Send JWT header as `X-JWT`. This shouldn't be used for web application, however can be helpful for service-to-service authentication.
2. Send JWT token as query parameter, i.e. `/something?token=<jwt>`
3. [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). This mode disabled by default and will be enabled if `Opts.AdminPasswd` defined. This will allow access with basic auth admin:<Opts.AdminPasswd> with user [admin](https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth/blob/master/middleware/auth.go#L24). Such method can be used for automation scripts.

### Logging

By default this library doesn't print anything to stdout/stderr, however user can pass a logger implementing `logger.L` interface with a single method `Logf(format string, args ...interface{})`. Functional adapter for this interface included as `logger.Func`. There are two predefined implementations in the `logger` package - `NoOp` (prints nothing, default) and `Std` wrapping `log.Printf` from stdlib.


## Register oauth2 providers

Authentication handled by external providers. You should setup oauth2 for all (or some) of them to allow users to authenticate. It is not mandatory to have all of them, but at least one should be correctly configured.

#### Google Auth Provider

1.  Create a new project: https://console.developers.google.com/project
2.  Choose the new project from the top right project dropdown (only if another project is selected)
3.  In the project Dashboard center pane, choose **"API Manager"**
4.  In the left Nav pane, choose **"Credentials"**
5.  In the center pane, choose **"OAuth consent screen"** tab. Fill in **"Product name shown to users"** and hit save.
6.  In the center pane, choose **"Credentials"** tab.
    * Open the **"New credentials"** drop down
    * Choose **"OAuth client ID"**
    * Choose **"Web application"**

## Status 

The library extracted from [remark42](https://github.com/umputun/remark) project. The original code in production use on multiple sites and seems to work fine. 

`go-pkgz/auth` library still in development and until version 1 released some breaking changes possible.
